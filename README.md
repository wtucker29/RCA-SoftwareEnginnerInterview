Create a simple login page that autenticates a user and says on another page that you have successfully logged in. From that login page create a way for to create a new login of username and password. You can use any languages (PHP, HTML, CSS, JavasScript, etc.) or any frameworks (React, Bootstrap, Flutter, Angular, Vue.js, etc.) To make it easier for authentication you do not need store the data outside the project so they can be hard coded like testing.

## Installation
You can do local hosting however you would like. We utilize MAMP Pro for our project for local hosting as it is really built around our LAMP Stack infrastrcure. You can download the free version of MAMP here: https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/. You can also just spin up a local host from the command line.

If you have any questions please reach out to me and I'll help as much as I can.

## Requirements
### Login page
    1. The login page should have a simple box in the center of the screen the takes a username and password.
    2. It should then authenticate that data however you want to do that.
        Example: On login button pressed javascript runs and gets the data from the form and then checks to see if storedUsername is equal to username captured from form
    3. If correct it should display on that box that you have logged in successfully

### New User page
    1. Create a way for a user to create a new user from the login page
    2. Have them set a username and password and confirm the password
    3. Check to make sure the password fulfills the requirements:
        1. Longer than 8 characters
        2. Contains an uppercase character
        3. Contains a symbol
    4. Then display that the user has successfully created a new user
    *** Note this new user does not need to work for the login page. It's more to check your abilities to work with strings.

### Other Notes
Be creative and don't stress about it. I just want to see a sample of your coding abilities and most importantly have fun!
